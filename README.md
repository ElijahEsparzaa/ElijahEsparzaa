## About Me

I am a Computer Science student Graduated from CSUF with hands-on experience across full-stack web development, real-time systems, Unity game development, cloud infrastructure, and applied machine learning. My work spans individual and team-based projects where I focus on clean architecture, system integration, and building reliable, user-facing applications.

I enjoy working at the intersection of software engineering and problem-solving whether that’s integrating complex systems, building interactive frontends, designing backend APIs, or creating gameplay systems that react to real-world data.

## Featured Capstone Project – Unity Game + Finance Web App Integration (Capstone Project)

**Repo:** https://github.com/Majekman/491-Project-Fork  
*(Fork of my original 491 Unity project with full integration changes)*

For my senior capstone project, my team was tasked with **integrating our standalone Unity roguelike game with a anoohter groups completely separate finance web application ** under a strict deadline. The goal was to create a meaningful connection between **real-world budgeting behavior and in-game difficulty.**

### What We Built
- Embedded our Unity game **directly into the finance web application**
- Connected budgeting and savings goal results to **real-time gameplay difficulty**
- Enemy spawn rates, difficulty scaling, and game behavior dynamically changed based on:
  - Whether users met their savings goals
  - Their financial performance by a specific due date

### Why This Matters
This project required:
- Rapid system design changes
- Cross-team coordination
- Adapting a standalone game architecture into a **data-driven, externally controlled system**
- Making gameplay systems responsive to backend business logic
- Required writing clear, in-depth, and easy to understand documentation so that new developers could onboard quickly and understand the system architecture, data flow, and integration logic
- Designed and maintained an organized, well-documented testing process to validate gameplay behavior, financial data integration, and system stability
- Implemented a full CI/CD pipeline to automate builds, testing, and deployment, mirroring real-world software engineering workflows and production practices

This experience closely mirrors real-world engineering challenges: integrating legacy systems, responding to late requirement changes, and delivering organized and working solutions under time constraints.
